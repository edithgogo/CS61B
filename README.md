# CS61B
Data Structures and Algorithms

My projects for CS61B, Fall 2019. http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa19/ . Not to be copied.

From instructors:

"Much of 61B will be concerned with the tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data. We'll also be concerned with the engineering knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately large programs."

Languages: Java
